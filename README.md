# 03 JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker
Web Based Application Tracker To Track Employees Payroll Expenses

## Description

For this week’s project I was given the starter code that would display an Employee Payroll Tracker on a web-based application. I had to modify the JavaScript code so that when a business owner or payroll manager entered an employee’s first name, last name and salary It would find the average salary of the employees, as well as pick a random drawing winner from the employees. Hopefully, for them it will be a nice prize.
This final project has a very professional look to it and is responsive to a multitude of screen sizes.

- My main motivation for this project was to see how much JavaScript I remembered. I started studying JS about 6 months ago, and stopped when I started studying HTML, and CSS to prep for this course.  
- I built this, as this is my first project combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript together.
- What problem does this project solve? It allows a business owner or payroll manager the ability to enter employee data into this Employee Payroll Tracker on any computer or mobile devise. This will allow for better time management when they are stuck in traffic, waiting for a flight at an airport, or have a few minutes between meetings. 
-What did I learn? I learned that I need to proofread my code better. Something as simple as () vs {} caused a lot of time wasted.  Overall, the writing of the code was fairly simple minus the one hang up.

## Installation

There are no special installation steps for this project. All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer.

## Usage

Once you have it in your local repository, on your computer, you can use Visual Studio Code to open the folder. Then you will see the JavaScript.js (currently with my pseudo-code notes in the top half) the index.html, the style.css and other associated files. You can then review the files, preview the script.js, style.css, and the index.html, and then open the index.html in a browser. Click on “Add Employees” to build your own tracker.
